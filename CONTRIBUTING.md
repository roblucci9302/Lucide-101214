## ðŸš€ Contribution Workflow

To ensure a smooth and effective workflow, all contributions must go through the following process. Please follow these steps carefully.

### 1. Find or Create an Issue

All work begins with an issue. This is the central place to discuss new ideas and track progress.

-   Browse our existing [**Issues**](https://github.com/pickle-com/glass/issues) to find something you'd like to work on. We recommend looking for issues labeled `good first issue` if you're new!
-   If you have a new idea or find a bug that hasn't been reported, please **create a new issue** using our templates.

### 2. Claim the Issue

To avoid duplicate work, you must claim an issue before you start coding.

-   On the issue you want to work on, leave a comment with the command:
    ```
    /assign
    ```
-   Our GitHub bot will automatically assign the issue to you. Once your profile appears in the **`Assignees`** section on the right, you are ready to start development.

### 3. Fork & Create a Branch

Now it's time to set up your local environment.

1.  **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine.
3.  **Create a new branch** from `main`. A clear branch name is recommended.
    -   For new features: `feat/short-description` (e.g., `feat/user-login-ui`)
    -   For bug fixes: `fix/short-description` (e.g., `fix/header-rendering-bug`)

### 4. Develop

Write your code! As you work, please adhere to our quality standards.

-   **Code Style & Quality**: Our project uses `Prettier` and `ESLint` to maintain a consistent code style.
-   **Architecture & Design Patterns**: All new code must be consistent with the project's architecture. Please read our **[Design Patterns Guide](https://github.com/pickle-com/glass/blob/main/docs/DESIGN_PATTERNS.md)** before making significant changes.

### 5. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Once your work is ready, create a Pull Request to the `main` branch of the original repository.

-   **Fill out the PR Template**: Our template will appear automatically. Please provide a clear summary of your changes.
-   **Link the Issue**: In the PR description, include the line `Closes #XXX` (e.g., `Closes #123`) to link it to the issue you resolved. This is mandatory.
-   **Code Review**: A maintainer will review your code, provide feedback, and merge it.

# Developing

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:
- [Node.js v20.x.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- (Windows users) [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

Ensure you're using Node.js version 20.x.x to avoid build errors with native dependencies.

```bash
# Check your Node.js version
node --version

# If you need to install Node.js 20.x.x, we recommend using nvm:
# curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
# nvm install 20
# nvm use 20
```

## Setup and Build

```bash
npm run setup
```
Please ensure that you can make a full production build before pushing code.



## Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

If you get errors, be sure to fix them before committing.
